# Reflection

## How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design by first identifying core system components and separating responsibilities. In this project, I divided the rendering pipeline into object creation, transformations, lighting setup, and camera management. This modular approach allowed me to incrementally build complexity while maintaining clarity in the overall structure.

## What new design skills has this project helped you craft?

This project strengthened my spatial reasoning and understanding of 3D coordinate systems. I developed a deeper understanding of transformation matrices and how translation, scaling, and rotation interact within a graphics pipeline.

## What design process did you follow?

I followed an iterative development model. I began with a minimal renderable scene and progressively added lighting, camera controls, and object refinement. Each milestone improved realism and structure.

## How could these tactics apply to future work?

The modular and incremental approach used here can be applied to larger systems, including cybersecurity tools and software engineering projects. Breaking problems into smaller components improves maintainability and scalability.

## How do I approach developing programs?

I focus on building small, testable components before integrating them into a complete system. For this project, I verified each transformation and lighting effect independently before combining them into the full scene.

## What new development strategies did you use?

I refined debugging strategies specific to graphical programming, including visual validation and matrix transformation testing.

## How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was critical. Adjustments to object positioning, lighting intensity, and camera angles were refined repeatedly until the final visual result was achieved.

## How has your coding approach evolved?

Throughout the milestones, I improved code organization and readability. I became more intentional about separating logic and reducing redundancy in the rendering pipeline.

## How can computer science help me reach my goals?

Computer science provides analytical and system-level thinking skills that directly support my long-term goal of working in cybersecurity. Understanding system architecture and visualization strengthens my ability to analyze complex digital environments.

## How do computational graphics apply to my educational pathway?

This course strengthened my understanding of linear algebra, transformation matrices, and rendering pipelines—concepts foundational to advanced computing topics.

## How do computational graphics apply to my professional pathway?

Visualization skills are highly relevant in cybersecurity and systems analysis. Understanding how data is represented visually enhances my ability to interpret monitoring dashboards, network activity, and system behaviors in professional environments.
